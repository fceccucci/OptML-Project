Your README is already very well structured and informative. Here's a refined version with minor improvements in clarity, formatting, consistency, and wording to make it even more professional and polished:

# Federated Learning with PyTorch Lightning and Flower

This project simulates **Federated Learning (FL)** using the [Flower](https://flower.dev/) framework and [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/). It supports multiple FL strategies (e.g., FedAvg, FedYogi, FedAdam, FedProx, FedAvgM) and allows experimentation with non-IID data distributions via configurable YAML files for models, datasets, and algorithms.

---

##  What is Federated Learning?

Federated Learning is a decentralized machine learning paradigm where clients (e.g., devices or data silos) train models locally on their private data. Only model updates (not raw data) are sent to a central server for aggregation. This enhances **data privacy**, **scalability**, and **compliance with data regulations**.

This project simulates that process using Flower's simulation engine and PyTorch Lightning's training loop.

## 🏁 Running Experiments

All training is launched via `main.py` using Hydra config files in the `conf/` directory.

###  Single Run:

```bash
python main.py --config-name=mnist_cnn_debug
```

### Multi-run Sweep:

```bash
python main.py -m --config-name=mnist_sweep
```

##  Performance & GPU

* Set available GPU via `backend_config.client_resources.num_gpus`.
* Enable mixed-precision via `trainer.precision` (e.g., `bf16-mixed`, `16-mixed`).
* Shared public datasets (for semi-supervised FL) are handled via `shared_data` config blocks.

---

##  Troubleshooting

* Check CUDA availability:

  ```python
  import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())
  ```
* Set `debug: True` in configs for verbose logging.
* For performance bottlenecks:

  * Reduce `num_clients`
  * Use smaller datasets (e.g., `FakeData`)
  * Lower `local_epochs` or enable CPU-only simulation
